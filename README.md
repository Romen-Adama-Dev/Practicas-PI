# Peripherals and Interfaces - Computer Engineering Degree

Welcome to the repository for the "Peripherals and Interfaces" course, part of the second year in the Computer Engineering degree program. In this course, we use the Proteus circuit simulation software to emulate an Arduino Mega and carry out various practical projects related to peripheral interaction and microcontrollers.

## Repository Contents
- **Code:** You'll find the source code for each practical projects in the "practicaX" directory.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation and project descriptions can be found inside of each practical section.
- **Resources:** Additional resources, such as datasheets or helpful links, are available in the main directory.
