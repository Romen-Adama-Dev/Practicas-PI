# Peripherals and Interfaces - Computer Engineering Degree

Welcome to the repository for the "Peripherals and Interfaces" course, part of the second year in the Computer Engineering degree program. In this course, we use the Proteus circuit simulation software to emulate an Arduino Mega and carry out various practical projects related to peripheral interaction and microcontrollers.

## Repository Contents
- **Code:** You'll find the source code for the practical projects in the "code" directory.
- **Schematics:** Schematic diagrams used in the projects are stored in the "schematics" folder.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation and project descriptions can be found in the "documentation" section.
- **Resources:** Additional resources, such as datasheets or helpful links, are available in the "resources" directory.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific project or topic you're interested in within the repository.
3. Follow the README instructions in each project folder to set up and run the code.

## Course Overview
This course explores the fascinating world of microcontroller interfacing and peripheral integration using the Arduino platform simulated with Proteus. It provides hands-on experience with various sensors, actuators, and communication modules.
